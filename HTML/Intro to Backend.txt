URL: uniform resource locator

?name=variable&name1=variable1 is used by GET method
#fragments: # is use to define fragments of a page, it is not send to the server as a request but only in browser.
fragments parameters will be last in case query parameters are also there

if we enter www.google.com/search in the action url of the form....the text will produce the google search results

get requests sometimes are cached but post are not. Since it gets cached...it should never be used to change something on the server but only to find something on the server.
